(ICGR)Integer chaos game representation :
- based on https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cmb.2018.0173?journalCo
- Encoding DNA sequences into 3 integers ( the first and the second integer represent the X and Y coordinates and the third number represents the length of the sequence ) that can be decoded back into the original sequence
- we added the ability to encode sequences longer than 1024 nucleotides
